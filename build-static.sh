#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# build-static.sh — produce a self-contained static bundle of the app in dist/.
#
# Vite is configured with `base: './'`, so the output is fully relative and can be served from any
# host or subpath. This script additionally bundles the saved per-diagram layouts as
# `/__layout/<id>` files: in dev/preview those are served by a Vite middleware, which a static host
# doesn't have, so we materialize them as plain JSON objects. That way the deployed site renders the
# same fine-tuned layouts as the exported GIFs. Diagrams without a saved layout fall back to the
# built-in code defaults automatically (loadLayout() returns empty on a 404).
#
# Usage:
#   ./build-static.sh              # install deps (if needed) + build -> dist/
#   SKIP_INSTALL=1 ./build-static.sh
